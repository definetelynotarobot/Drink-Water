# Drink-Water
This is a project that I have done in 50 days 50 JavaScript projects with Brad Traversy. It represents your daily drinking water needs!

I also added an another branch called "coffee".

While building this project I learned a lot about Git Bash(pull, merge, commit, making or deleting directories), vanilla JavaScript, DOM. It was fun to build a website that people can interact with.
